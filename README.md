# KaseiCoin Crowdsale

As a blockchain developer, you have been tasked with creating a new cryptocurrency for use on the first human colony of Mars. The currency will be based on blockchain technology and will be called "KaseiCoin". The coin will be an ERC-20 fungible token and the program will launch a crowdsale that will allow the space travelers to convert their earth money to KaseiCoin.

## Technologies

This application was written in Solidity for use on the Ethereum blockchain.
In order to run or edit the code, you'll have to use a Solidity IDE and compiler. We used a web based IDE called Remix to write, compile and deploy our transactions. Ganache was used as our personal local Ethereum blockchain and we used Metamask in Google Chrome as our wallet in order to connect to our test network and facilitate transactions. OpenZeppelin libraries were imported to facilitate the creation of the ERC-20 tokens and facilitate the crowdsale.

## Installation Guide

Install Ganache on your machine. You can find the link to it above. Install Metamask on your machine using Google Chrome and make sure you install the extension in Chrome for ease of use. Remix is browser based and doesn't need to be installed. Simply open Google Chrome and navigate to ```remix.ethereum.org``` and click on file explorer icon to load the files ```KaseiCoin.sol``` and ```KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol```. You will then be able to fully interact with the programs and deploy smart contracts.
